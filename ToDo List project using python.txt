To-Do List (Python Console Project)

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application built in Python.
It allows users to manage their daily tasks directly from the terminal using a simple menu system.

🚀 Features

📋 View Tasks – Displays all tasks in the current To-Do list with numbering.

➕ Add Task – Allows the user to enter a new task and adds it to the list.

➖ Remove Task – Removes the last task from the list (LIFO order).

❌ Quit Option – Exits the program safely.

🛡️ Validation – Prevents errors by checking if the list is empty before removing a task.

💻 How It Works

When the program starts, it checks if your To-Do list is empty and displays it.

You are given three options:

1 → Add Task

2 → Remove Task

3 → Quit the program

The list updates after each action, giving real-time feedback.
